# SuperDuper Brewery

A fake brewery website, created as final project as a student
at John Bryce Training College.

### What are we brewing here?

I used Angular 2+ frame work for the frontend,
for the Api I used ExpressJS and Mongoose Libraries,
for my database I used MongoDb.

#

In this project I'm demonstrating my skills
by writing clean reusable code, making the most
out of the tools I've learnt.

For the design i used CSS and the Angular Material Library.
